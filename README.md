# About this project
This project is a small flashcard app where you can create flashcards, sort them, start a quiz, and get a score... This app is for students (like me) to help them study more efficiently and help them gain time, something that is pretty important for a student (from my pov)
It is made in Python (even though it's probably not the best choice), and the interface is a bit old, but I wanted to code it in Python to focus more on the functionalities than the aesthetics (I guess ?)

# How to use it

  The "Timer" tab is to set the timer for the quiz; you can enter any value you want.
